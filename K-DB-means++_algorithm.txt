1. Normalize features of the dataset and ensure every feature is comparable in scale to every other feature
2. Computer measure of spread of the entire dataset with the average distance between nodes
3. Define density radius r0 based on the spread of the dataset (large r0 for widely spread data, smaller r0 for tightly clustered data); average distance * an alpha value (0.2 for now, can be changed)
4. For each instance xi in dataset X:
    look at the neighborhood around the data point in the radius of r0 and count how many points fall inside that neighborhood, that's the density value for that point
5. Select the point with highest density as the first centroid
6. Until k centroids are picked:
    Choose the next centroid by calculating the distance of every node to its closest centroid, select the node with the highest density * distance^2 value (k-means++ implementation)
7. Record those centroids and use them in Scikit's K-Means algorithm
